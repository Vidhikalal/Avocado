# Avocado 🥑 — plan your next move

**Avocado** is an affordability intelligence engine that helps users understand the true cost of living in any major city. Designed for students, newcomers, families, and relocating professionals, Avocado provides a complete data-driven breakdown of all major lifestyle expenses and city conditions.

The platform analyzes real-time data, economic indicators, news sentiment, and a custom weighted ML model to generate the **AvoScore**, a 0–10 affordability index that reflects how financially livable a city is.

**AvoScore Legend**  
- **3 → Low cost**  
- **4–7 → Mid cost**  
- **8+ → Expensive**

## What Avocado Delivers

Avocado provides a consolidated, real-time snapshot of a city’s livability, including:

- Cost-of-living data across rent, groceries, dining, and transit  
- Purchasing power and economic stability  
- Crime, safety, transportation, and finance-related news  
- Live weather and environmental conditions  
- City sentiment computed from real-time news feeds  
- A machine-learning powered affordability score (AvoScore)  
- Gemini-powered conversational insights for interpretation  

The goal is simple:  
**Help users make informed, data-backed decisions about where to live.**

## AvoScore — The Affordability Engine

The AvoScore is produced through a hybrid weighted ML model that combines classification, regression, and sentiment analysis to deliver a stable, interpretable affordability measure.

### Feature Inputs

| Category | Features |
|----------|----------|
| Housing | Rent index, price-to-income ratio |
| Groceries | Grocery index |
| Dining | Restaurant index |
| Safety | Crime index, safe-walking-at-night score |
| Economics | Local purchasing power, employment volatility |
| Transport | Transit accessibility and cost |
| Weather | Climate & comfort score |
| Sentiment | VADER sentiment from real-time news |

## EDA & Preprocessing

Libraries and methods used:

- **pandas** — data ingestion, merging, cleanup  
- **numpy** — numerical transformations  
- **matplotlib**, **seaborn** — visualization and correlation analysis  
- **scikit-learn** — scaling, preprocessing, and baselines  
- **scipy** — outlier detection (IQR trimming)  
- **NLTK (VADER)** — sentiment analysis  
- **pycountry**, **geopy** — city validation and coordinate mapping

## Modeling Approach

Avocado uses a two-stage ML pipeline:

### 1. Logistic Regression (Classification Baseline)
Predicts affordability tiers:
- Low  
- Medium  
- High  

### 2. XGBoost Regressor  
Generates a continuous affordability score.

### Weighted Ensemble Formula

```
AvoScore =
  (0.70 * XGBoost) +
  (0.15 * city_sentiment) +
  (0.10 * weather_comfort) +
  (0.05 * local_purchase_power)
```

This weighted method provides balanced predictions across diverse cities, smoother scoring, and improved generalization.
